I build startup, write code and learn something new about the world every day!

Something about me:

- Grew up in [Hangzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou), spent most of my life in Hangzhou and San Francisco Bay Area.
- Live in San Francisco, CA and travel often.
- I am a 👩‍💻 software engineer in training, studied computer science at Berkeley but I enjoy wearing different hats!
- Currently building [Blockcast](https://blockcast.network/), at a fascinating intersection of physical infrastructure and crypto (Best job I've had so far)
- ENTP / INTP, Enneagram Type 7
- My personal values include: adventure, kindness, growth, empowerment, openness and connection

Plz do reach out if you think we would vibe or if I can be helpful in any ways. I can easily be motivated by a 🎾 game, food adventure, a walk, good ☕ or 🍵.
