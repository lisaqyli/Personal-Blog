I currently live in San Francisco. I grew up in [Hangzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou)

I’m generally curious about other people’s stories and life. I’m quite open to make new friends especially when we are able to meet up IRL or have shared hobbies. Plz do reach out if you think we would have a good conversation or if I can be helpful in any ways. I can easily be found at weird corners of the Internet but also on twitter too.
